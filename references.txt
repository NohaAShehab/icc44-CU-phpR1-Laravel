"Migration files --> create db structure"
1- migrations
https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/migrations

2- available datatype
https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/migrations#creating-columns

note that all columns in tables are not null by default unless you say something else.


3- How can the laravel application deals with database ::
This the role of the model class

let's create model class ?

best practice --> if you have table --> students  ---so name its related model as Student



----> Models
https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/eloquent
data retrieval

--- use tinker tool -->to simulate how laravel gets the data from database
https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/eloquent#retrieving-models

php artisan tinker
in the controller
use App\Models\Student;
$students = Student::all();


use query builder
https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/queries
